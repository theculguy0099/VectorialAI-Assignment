**Agent 1 (The Analyst):**
> "By examining dialogue exchanges, I notice that characters often reveal their motivations and evolve in response to conflict. For example, in 'The Godfather', Michael Corleone's transformation is evident in his changing tone and assertiveness. [The Godfather, Michael Corleone, L1045]"

**Agent 2 (The Mentor):**
> "I observe that characters frequently provide guidance or wisdom to others, shaping their growth. For instance, Yoda in 'The Empire Strikes Back' imparts lessons that influence Luke's maturity. [The Empire Strikes Back, Yoda, L2034]"

**Agent 3 (The Comic):**
> "Humor is a powerful tool for character development! Characters like Donkey in 'Shrek' use jokes to break tension and build relationships. [Shrek, Donkey, L3092]"
